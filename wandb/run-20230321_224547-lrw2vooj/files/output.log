Some weights of the model checkpoint at google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k were not used when initializing ViTForImageClassification: ['pooler.dense.weight', 'pooler.dense.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing ViTForImageClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing ViTForImageClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of ViTForImageClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k and are newly initialized: ['classifier.weight', 'classifier.bias']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
