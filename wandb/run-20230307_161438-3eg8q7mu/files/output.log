Some weights of the model checkpoint at google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k were not used when initializing ViTForImageClassification: ['pooler.dense.bias', 'pooler.dense.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing ViTForImageClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing ViTForImageClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of ViTForImageClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
PyTorch: setting up devices
The default value for the training argument `--report_to` will change in v5 (from all installed integrations to none). In v5, you will need to use `--report_to all` to get the same behavior as now. You should start updating your code and make this info disappear :-).

The following columns in the training set don't have a corresponding argument in `ViTForImageClassification.forward` and have been ignored: Hull Type, Rigging Type, name, img, Construction, Ballast Type, Designer. If Hull Type, Rigging Type, name, img, Construction, Ballast Type, Designer are not expected by `ViTForImageClassification.forward`,  you can safely ignore this message.
